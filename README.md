**WarBerryPi** was built to be used as a hardware implant during red teaming scenarios where we want to obtain as much information 
as possible in a short period of time with being as stealth as possible. 
Just find a network port and plug it in. The scripts have been designed in a way that the approach is targeted to avoid noise 
in the network that could lead to detection and to be as efficient as possible. 
The WarBerry script is a collection of scanning tools put together to provide that functionality.



#### Disclaimer
This tool is only for academic purposes and testing  under controlled environments. Do not use without obtaining proper authorization
from the network owner of the network under testing.

               sudo python warberry.py -I eth0 -i -T3       Use the eth0 interface and T3 scanning intensity
               sudo python warberry.py -I eth0 -N HackerPC  Use the eth0 interface and change hostname to HackerPC

```


More usage examples can be found at the '**[Examples](https://github.com/secgroundzero/warberry/wiki/examples)**' wiki page.


### Installation

Detailed installation steps can be found at the '**[Installation](https://github.com/secgroundzero/warberry/wiki/installation)**' wiki page.



### Reporting 
Download the **/WarBerry/RESULTS** folder into the **REPORTING/RESULTS** folder and open reporting.html.
Apache is needed for the reporting tool to work. In Windows download XAMMP and install Apache.


### Important

The tool in case of MAC address filtering enumerates by default the subnets specified under ***/home/pi/WarBerry/warberry/discover***.
This is done for the tool to run quicker.
If you want to enumerate more subnets either add the subnets in that file or change line 154 in rest_bypass.py so that it does not
read from the file.


### Running Status

If you are connecting through SSH you can check the status of the attacks by checking the results_status file under Results. The file gets
updated after each phase is completed.
