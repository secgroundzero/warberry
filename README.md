**WarBerryPi** was built to be used as a hardware implant during red teaming scenarios where we want to obtain as much information 
as possible in a short period of time with being as stealth as possible. 
Just find a network port and plug it in. The scripts have been designed in a way that the approach is targeted to avoid noise 
in the network that could lead to detection and to be as efficient as possible. 
The WarBerry script is a collection of scanning tools put together to provide that functionality.



#### Disclaimer
This tool is only for academic purposes and testing  under controlled environments. Do not use without obtaining proper authorization
from the network owner of the network under testing.

```



### Installation

Run ```sudo bash setup.sh```


#### To address the issue with ImportError: No module named dns follow these steps

~~git clone https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython; 
cd dnspython/; 
python setup.py install~~


#### As DNSPYTHON is now in version 2.x and rely on python3, that cannot be used for warberry. to fix that issue it is needed to deploy older version via pip (1.16.0 - the latest with python2)

```
pip install dnspython==1.16.0
```



### Reporting 

Download the **/RESULTS** folder into /var/www, /Library/Webserver/Documents/  or XAMPP web directory depending on your OS and setup.

Download the warberry.db file locally and save it into **Reporting/** .

Change file Config.php under Reporting/WarberryReporting/SQLiteConnection/php to use the correct path of warberry.db

Run index.html under **Reporting/**
